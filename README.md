# CloudHealthManagementSystem1
The project consists of implementation of two websites in the cloud using HTML, CSS, JS for frontend and Node.js in backend. The websites can be deployed using the docker files.

Motivation: 
One of the most important aspects of cloud-based health management is to make accessible EHRs (Electronic Health Records) to both the healthcare providers and the patients in real-time. Maintaining health records physically is a cumbersome task and often might lead to loss of beneficial data like the medications that the patient currently having, recent tests he had and their results, etc. 

Objective:
Basically created two websites and deployed using containerization –
1. For the health care providers – Health Care provider login
2. For the patients – Patient Login

Patient-login is for patients to check out their EHRs and get to know there ongoing appointments.
Health Care provider login (Doctor-login) is for creating EHRs for patients and booking appointments on their behalf.

The EHRs and appointment details are stored in the mongoDB database and can be updated only via Health Care provider login.
